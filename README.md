I tried to refactor the code in [1] and [2], to make it more "good-looking". Whether the result is really better than the original, is disputable. "There's no accounting for taste." :-)

_Note._ [2] is under GNU General Public License. Thus, the part of the code that is based on [2] is under GPL. On the other hand, the text of the paper [1] is not under GPL. Hence, the code that is directly based on [1] needn't be under GPL (and it is not).
